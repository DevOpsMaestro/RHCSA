= RHCSA for RHEL7

[.lead]
All of this content is started from the objectives enumerated here:

https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex200-red-hat-certified-system-administrator-rhcsa-exam

The commands below are pulled from a combination of Googling for said, and/or books on RHEL7, specifically:

* Red Hat RHCSA/RHCE 7 Cert Guide: Red Hat Enterprise Linux by Sander Van Vugt

** ISBN-13: 978-0-7897-5405-9 

* RHCSA & RHCE Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7: Training and Exam Preparation Guide, Third Edition, by Asghar Ghori

** ISBN: 978-1-4951-4820-0

**_IMPORTANT:_**

**When you take the exam, all of the content on the exam is bound by the certification's Terms of Service. Which includes a privacy policy, stating that it is against the Terms of Service to provide information or exact tasks that are performed inside of the certification.** 

This Cheatsheet uses the Objectives listed on the Official Red Hat site to list out the objectives, and then shows **_a way_** to solve those objectives from the command line. It is noteworthy of expressing, that some of the commands don't explain what they do. This cheatsheet is for myself. The commands are to joggle my memory and the commands needed to accomplish the goal. If you don't understand what the command does, please read the man or info page on the command or topic. Run the commands inside of a virtual machine with a snapshot of the baseline install. That way, if you mess up, you can reset the VM back to the snapshot.

This file is also a living document in that as I find new ways to solve these objectives, I will update this document without violating the Terms of Service.

[[essential-tools]]
== Understand and use essential tools

=== Access a shell prompt and issue commands with correct syntax

  Right click on the desktop, in the menu, click on Terminal.

=== Use input-output redirection (>, >>, |, 2>, etc.)
[source,bash]
----
$ cat /etc/motd /etc/issue > /tmp/foo.txt
$ command 2>/dev/null  # <1>
$ command &>> /tmp/output.log  # <2>
$ command 2>&1 | grep "command"  # <3>
----
<1> redirect errors to /dev/null
<2> redirect both errors and standard out to a file, appending to it.
<3> redirect std err to std out, then pipe both in one stream to the second command.

=== Use grep and regular expressions to analyze text
[source,bash]
----
$ grep "string1" <filename>  # <1>
$ 
$ grep -i ^o.*,$ lotr.txt  # <2>
$ grep -i ^[o,i] lotr.txt
$ 
$ grep -n -E '^O|l{2}' lotr.txt
2:Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
4:One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
6:One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
7:One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them,
----
<1> Grep is super usefull for either finding a string or removing a string (with the *_-v_* flag).
<2> Use *_-i_* to make the search case insenitive.

=== Access remote systems using SSH
[source,bash]
----
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096  # <1>
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/<identity_file> <user>@<hostname>  # <2>
$ 
$ ssh -v student@server1
$ 
$ scp local_file <user>@<hostname>:/tmp/destination_filename
$ scp <user>@<hostname>:/tmp/source_file_name  /home/user/local_destination_filename
$
$ sftp <user>@<hostname>
> ls file1
> get file1
> mkdir test
> put my_local_filename
> quit | bye | exit
$
$ ssh -X <user>@<hostname>    ## ssh in with xterm enabled
----
<1> Create a key, _type_ is *rsa*, _bit_ size is *4096*.
<2> Copy the public key to the remote target.

| Command | Description | Notes

|tar -cvzf /tmp/my_archive.tgz /home/my_user/files.* |Create archive, compress, verbose mode | the default file extension most people use is *_.tgz_*.
|tar -xzvf /tmp/my_archive.tgz |Extract, compressed, verbose | 
|tar -xzvf ./homes.tar.gz -C /tmp/ |Extract, compressed, verbose to destination directory | the *_-C_* option will write the contents of the archive, in this case to the /tmp dir.

|star -c -f=myarchive.tar directory1/ file1 file2| Create a tar archive|Must remember the *_-f=_* flag for file.
|star -t -f=myachive.tar |Test archive|Must remember the *_-f=_* flag for file.
|star -x -f=myarhive.tar |Extract archive|Must remember the *_-f=_* flag for file.

|gzip /tmp/some.file |Create compressed file |The default file extension is *_.gz_*
|gunzip /tmp/some.file.gz |Extract compressed file | 

|bzip2 /tmp/some.file |Create compressed file |bzip2 optimizes compression on text based files, but de-optimizes compression horribly on binary files 
|bunzip2 /tmp/some.file.bz2 |Extract compressed file | 
|===

=== Create and edit text files

  I highly recommend learning the vi command. 
  It is literally on every UNIX and Linux system.
  You could use 'nano' as a third party editor, 
    but when you boot into single user mode, 
    third party tools are not available.
  Spend some time learning 'vi' and the different modes. 
  'vimtutor' is your friend here. It will teach you everything you need to know. <1>
  If it is not installed, run: 'sudo yum whatprovides vimtutor',
  and install that package.

<1> Again, *_vimtutor_* is one of the most useful tools for learning _vi_.

.Interrupt the boot process in order to gain access to a system
[cols="1m,1a", options="header", width="98%"]
|===
| Sequence | Notes

|Stop the boot loader -> 

'e' ->

scroll down to line starting with: linux16

append at the end of the line: 'rd.break' -> 

key-sequence: CTRL+X ->

mount -o remount,rw /sysroot ->

chroot /sysroot ->

passwd root ->

touch /.autorelabel -> 

exit -> exit
|This looks like a fairly complicated mess, but it is easy to perform:

* Stop the boot sequence with any key, then press 'e' for edit mode.

* use the arrow keys to navigate down and append to the line.

* once booted, you are in a Read-Only state, you can verify this with the command 'mount'

* change the mounted state of '/sysroot' to Read-Write

* chroot runs an interactive shell within a special root directory

* adjust the passwd

* *_YOU MUST_* touch the '/.autorelabel' file in order to trigger SELinux to relabel the FS, otherwise this won't work correctly on reboot.

* exit out twice, the system will then boot into the normal runlevel/target mode.

sudo nice -n -17 ./my_program

in the second example, I am saying to use '-17' for my value. I was taught never to use *_-20_* unless you are running a real-time system, e.g. factory manufactoring line.

|renice [-n] priority identifier

sudo renice -n -10 <PID>
|alter priority of running processes|I always use the -n to adjust the priority. Remember, this takes from the current Priority value and then adds or subtracts from that value the number you specified. I just tested this with a number running at +20, so my negative ten then adjusted the priority to postive ten from the original value.

=== Preserve system journals

Journald logs are stored in the /run/log/journal directory and disappear after a reboot by default.
To persistt Journald logs across reboots, perform the following sequence:
```
# mkdir /var/log/journal
# echo "SystemMaxUse=512M" >> /etc/systemd/journald.conf
# systemctl restart systemd-journald 
```
*_Important_* Setting the _SystemMaxUse_ variable is necessary because otherwise 10% of the filesystem where the /var/log/journal directory is stored may be used at maximum by the journal.

|partprobe|Inform the OS of partition table changes|*_partprobe_* is a program that informs the OS kernel of partition table changes, by requesting that the OS re-read the partition table.
|===

  Working Examples of fdisk, gdisk, and partprobe.
  If you have not used these tools before, you need to
  setup a virtual machine and add several extra virtual disks,
  and use both of these tools until you know them by heart.
  If you have an older system that you must fix/adjust,
  you might need fdisk. It works!
  For new systems, I recommend using gdisk to perform all operations.
  Knowing both tools, you will be able to cover all situations 
  for formatting hard drives.

```
=== Add new partitions and logical volumes, and swap to a system non-destructively
You’ve got three options when adding some swap space to a system:

* use a logical volume inside a volume group.
* use a new partition.

=== Generate Fake Data to fill up partition
I used this command sequence to generate fake data on the fly to fill up a partition.

Using a generic LVM2 partition that was originally setup at 240MiB in size.
Genereate 224M of fake data to populate this volume.
The idea is that you have a volume that is almost full and the users are 
complaining that they need more space to do their jobs.
